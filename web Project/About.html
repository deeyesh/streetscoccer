<h2>RULES</h2>	
	<h3>Player Rules</h3>
	
<ol type="1">
<li>No Body Contact. This means no shoulder to shoulder that results in any movement of the other player’s body. This means no using your body to “box out” (body to body) another player. This means no “ball first and body second” contact. 50 – 50 balls that result in contact/collisions will be awarded to the keeper on that side of the field.  A restart. Ball Contact Only.  Think Basketball.</li>
<br/>
<li>Player who is in control of the ball has right of way, unless the defender has both feet planted. Defender must tackle the ball or strip the ball off of a player without touching the player. Offensive player cannot charge or run into a stationary defender or any part of a stationary defender’s body. Think Basketball “Charging.”</li>
<br/>
<li>Any tackle that trips another player is a Yellow Card & 2 Minutes – intentional or not Any simulation of a physical foul (flopping, diving, etc) where a player could have kept their footing, is a Yellow Card & 2 Minutes for the simulator.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Goalkeeper Rules</h3>

<ol type="i">
<li>The goalkeeper can score goals.</li>
<li>The goalkeeper can leave the penalty area and play on the field (includes the attacking half).</li>
<li>(Hermit Crab Rule) The goalkeeper cannot re-enter the penalty area with the ball once he/she has left the penalty area . The goalkeeper must give up possession of the ball before re-entering.</li>
<li>The goalkeeper cannot hold the ball longer than 5 seconds in his/her penalty area (“playing for time”).</li>
<li>The goalkeeper cannot roll the ball to him or herself after a goal has been conceded or a dead ball.</li>
<li>The goalkeeper cannot pick up the ball with his/her hands when the ball is outside the Penalty Area. A violation results in a penalty kick.</li>
<li>The “no pass back” rule applies. If a goalkeeper picks the ball up with his/her hands after receiving a pass back from a teammate (even if the goalkeeper has both feet in the Penalty Area), then the other team is awarded a penalty kick</li>
</ol>

<h3>Rules for Penalty</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>Outfield players cannot enter the penalty area. This rule applies to both attacking and defending players (“fishing for the ball” is not allowed).</li>
<li>If a player from the defending team enters the penalty area, the other team receives a penalty kick</li>
<li>If a player from the attacking team enters the penalty area, the play is blown dead and the ball starts with the goalkeeper.</li>
<li>A penalty kick is taken from half-field. The player will start at half-field, dribble the ball forward and attempt to score on the keeper. The kick-taker can use as many touches as he or she needs, but, the moment the ball stops moving towards the goal or moves backwards from the goal the penalty is blown dead. The goalkeeper cannot leave the penalty area during a penalty kick.</li>

</ol>	

<h3>Forfeit Rules</h3>

<ol type="I">
<li>If a team knows that it will have to forfeit for lack of players, the team must give advanced notice to the league general manager.</li>
<li>If a team does not have 4 players at the start of the game, the team may play the game with 3 players.</li>
<li>Any fewer than 3 players on a team is a forfeit. Teams can still play a “scrimmage” match in these situations by “picking up” players from another team (provided the other team lends them players), but the result of this scrimmage match is still recorded as a forfeit in the match results.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Fouls</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>Yellow Card (two minutes time exclusion): For fouls or unfair play, a player will be excluded from the match for two minutes during which time the team has to play with one less player. A player given a yellow card will be sent off for two minutes and not allowed back on. After two minutes have elapsed the player given the yellow card. Penalty time will carry over into the next half if the yellow card occurred within the last two minutes of the previous half. Player forward rule does not apply to the team that is short one player during the penalty period.</li>
<li>Red Card (match penalty): For serious foul play a player is excluded from the rest of the match. The team has to play with one less player for the remainder of the match. A red card will only be given for serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, threatening/abusive language, or a second yellow card for the same player. The player will be sent off immediately and not be allowed back during the game. No replacement player will be allowed on. The same applies to coaches. Each evening the disciplinary committee will meet and decide what action to take against the player or coach. Sanctions include suspension from future games.</li>
